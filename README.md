The dataset is available in the above link.
### Task: house price prediction (evaluation: hit score)
The dataset contains 60k rows of training data and 10k rows of testing data. Each row represents the feature vector (dim = 234) of a house, containing attributes such as the number of floors, the area of the building and land, and the location of the building. The house price can range from 2e5 to 3e9, which can be challenging for pridiction. The keys to success are definitely feature engineering and designing appropriate regression techniques. I build a neural network in Keras and ensemble lightgbm models as my final submission.
